Every value in every file is in SI units.

The file names are self-explanatory: if it has "class" in the name, then it's a class; if it has a method in the name, then it's that calculation method.
The file name will also have pendulum, spring, or elastic_pendulum. That's saying what the file is simulating.

I'd also like to point out how every file has two letters in its name. If you sort the files in alphabetical order you will see a pattern. I recommend reading the files in that order.
